#Sourdough Starter Journal

Day 7:
Yesterday I experimented with an all purpose batch of flour. The yeast didn\'t seem to take well to that so I switched back to whole wheat. The whole wheat reserve is running low but there should be enough to either get the starter to a stable, bubbly state or for the new shipment of flour to arrive.

The yeast is finally putting out a slight sour note but it's been a longer wait than I expected. The pancakes from the daily halving has been nice but I'm really looking forward to sourdough pizzas.
