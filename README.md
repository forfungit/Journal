#Sourdough Starter Journal

Day 7:
Yesterday I experimented with an all purpose batch of flour. The yeast didn\'t seem to take well to that so I switched back to whole wheat. The whole wheat reserve is running low but there should be enough to either get the starter to a stable, bubbly state or for the new shipment of flour to arrive.

The yeast is finally putting out a slight sour note but it's been a longer wait than I expected. The pancakes from the daily halving has been nice but I'm really looking forward to sourdough pizzas.


Day 8:

Good news all around. Received 25lb shipment of whole wheat. With supplies secure, and the weather being ideal, the starter is flourishing. Yesterday, I setup a test batch of pizza dough. I made a margharita pizza today and it didn\'t go poorly. I have the ingredients to thank. Excellent marinara and burrata cheese. The dough didn\'t rise but neither did it burn. Four more dough balls in the fridge ready for this week. As for the starter, I\'ve decided to refrigerate it. It may be a bit soon but prep work is stressful.
