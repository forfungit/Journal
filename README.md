#Sourdough Starter Journal

Day 7:

Yesterday I experimented with an all purpose batch of flour. The yeast didn\'t seem to take well to that so I switched back to whole wheat. The whole wheat reserve is running low but there should be enough to either get the starter to a stable, bubbly state or for the new shipment of flour to arrive.

The yeast is finally putting out a slight sour note but it's been a longer wait than I expected. The pancakes from the daily halving has been nice but I'm really looking forward to sourdough pizzas.


Day 8:

Good news all around. Received 25lb shipment of whole wheat. With supplies secure, and the weather being ideal, the starter is flourishing. Yesterday, I setup a test batch of pizza dough. I made a margharita pizza today and it didn\'t go poorly. I have the ingredients to thank. Excellent marinara and burrata cheese. The dough didn\'t rise but neither did it burn. Four more dough balls in the fridge ready for this week. As for the starter, I\'ve decided to refrigerate it. It may be a bit soon but prep work is stressful.
Day 16

Last week I tested part of the sourdough in a dough batch used in several pizzas and the results were ok. I now know that the starter wasn't ready for primetime just yet. This week however, circumstances have changed. The starter had about a week of refridgeration before the next batch of pizza. Seperately, a removed 50g for a spinoff starter using all purpose. I noticed the day after that the yeast in this spinoff starter was very active. I switched it back to whole wheat to see if it would still be virile and indeed it is popping! I have it on a 6 hour feed cycle boy is it hungry. I split it in half at feed time and the pancakes from this are very fluffy and delightful. I am contemplating when I should start making bread. I may keep this spinoff starter going indefinitely since I have a surplus of flour.

On the matter of the  pizza dough, I am happy to say that it is turning out very well compared to the prior week's batch. The crust is fluffy and of course the ingredients are on point. I believe I used less water which seems to mean that the dough will dry faster throughout the week. I'll just have to consume them quickly! Eating well as always.
